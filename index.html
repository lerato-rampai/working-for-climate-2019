              A more fomula definition can be regarded as a system of economic activities related to the production, 
              distribution and consumption of goods and services that result in improved human wellbeing over long 
              term while not exposing future generation to significant environmental risks or ecological scarcities.

              Although climate change is a natural occurance, human, industrial and development activities over the past 
              two centuries have caused changes in climate independent from natural changes. Climate change is a slow, 
              natural cycle that causes the earth's temperature to rise and fall periodically over centuries. Human 
              intervention, however, has speed up the process and has had catastrophic effects across the globe. All 
              ecosystems and biodiversities are threatened by climate change and its effects are remarkable on all life.

              Climate change has a profound impact on human life, it influences temperature shifts, food security, water 
              resources, greenhouse gasses. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.environment.gov.za/sites/default/files/legislations/national_climatechange_response_whitepaper.pdf"

              climate change responses. These documents represent the primary output of the climate change monitoring 
              and evaluation (M&E) framework and the 2015 annual report is the first of these progress reports. It 
              focuses on providing a narrative of the information that the DEA's climate change branch has collated

              This initiative will not only be a drive for a mass recruitment campaign and entrepreneur participation, 
              supplementing our government programs, will further also be the answer to our manifesto and creating 6 
              million works opportunities by 2019.

          <p>
              Many of which will be of a long duration.This phase of our democratic 
              transition calls for bold and decisive steps to place the economy on a qualitative difference path that 
              eliminates poverty and unemployment creates sustainable livelihoods and substantially reduces inequality.

              radical socio-economic agenda over the next 20 years. Its implementation will be a people-drive process 
              to which everyone is able to contribute.
